# What I found interesting
The website linked above is the portfolio of software developer Bruno Simons, which he created with Three.js (3D library of Javascript). What I found interesting was the fact that his portfolio is a project itself. It is my first time seeing such an interactive portfolio. You can use the arrow keys to travel through it like a fully functioning game. He even included sound effects for the car as it moved around the screen. Very impressive work.
